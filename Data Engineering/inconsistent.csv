Although we weren't entirely satisfied with the taste, we had a few points to address and were confused about the ingredients in the soup.

We didn't smell any pleasant aromas, and the flavor of the soup left us puzzled. We ordered the 红枣鱼, but it had a strong fishy taste, and we even found sand in the clams. The portion of rice was small, and what made us hesitate even more was the additional charge of RM1 per small packet of tissues. We believe that providing complimentary tissues is a basic service for a restaurant, especially one of such size.

We bravely tried their signature spicy dish, B-0.5, but the spiciness exceeded our expectations. It completely overshadowed the flavor of the soup and left us feeling overwhelmed by the fiery sensation, making it difficult to adapt.

Overall, we were not satisfied with our experience at this restaurant and have decided not to visit again.

We ordered two of their cakes, expecting something high-quality to match the ambiance and pricing. Instead, we was served the driest, roughest cakes we've ever tasted, especially disappointing for a café located in a premium mall. It tasted stale, lacked moisture, and had a texture more fitting of something left out for days than a freshly made dessert.
For a brand with such a strong reputation and aesthetic appeal, this level of quality is simply unacceptable. It felt like all the attention went into the branding and decor, with none left for product quality. We genuinely expected more from such an upscale location.

While the location is undeniably nice and the servers were friendly and attentive, our experience was unfortunately ruined by the manager’s attitude.

We made a reservation in advance and specifically requested a sofa table by the edge to enjoy the view. The reservation was confirmed, but when we arrived, the manager led us to a small table in the center with no view. When I reminded him of our request, he dismissed it coldly, saying that couples weren’t allowed to sit by the edge. His tone and demeanor were condescending—he made us feel like we didn’t matter and that he was doing us a favor by seating us at all.

The worst part? We could clearly see another couple seated in the sofa area, along with several other small groups of just 3–4 people. So the explanation we were given didn’t hold up, and it felt like we were being singled out unfairly.

We stayed briefly only because the entrance fee included two drinks, but left as soon as we could. The DJ didn’t help the mood either.

First, the El Cero Eco Fresh Salad (RM27).
The menu lists Spanish chicken sausage slices, kidney beans, roasted peppers, chickpeas, croutons, spinach, rocket leaves, Parmesan, green apple, and olive oil.
What arrived: missing the sausage, beans, peppers, and chickpeas. After pointing it out, the staff remade it - this time only adding the sausage…Still no beans, no peppers, no chickpeas.
When I asked again, I was told they had “added more croutons.”
Really? A few croutons to replace all the missing vegetables?
That’s not a substitution, that’s cutting corners.

They offered another complimentary salad as apology, but honestly, the entire dining experience was already ruined.
A customer shouldn’t have to chase the kitchen twice just to get what the menu promises.

Second, the lamb dish.
Served last, it was so tough that cutting into it made the whole table wobble, and chewing it was close to impossible.
We simply gave up on the dish.

While the staff on the floor tried to stay polite, the inconsistency from the kitchen and the lack of genuine service recovery left us disappointed.

I honestly don’t understand what’s with the overrated reviews on Google. There are plenty of restaurants nearby.
Do walk around and you’ll definitely find a better spot for a lovely evening.
Not a place I’d recommend.

​""Our recent visit to Hutong Food Court, inspired by a positive YouTube review, unfortunately proved to be a significant letdown. It became apparent that the venue's primary target audience is tourists, as we noted that a majority of the stalls (approximately 90%) were operated by foreign workers. This observation prompted us to lower our expectations for an authentic local food experience.

​To provide a fair assessment, we ordered three different dishes from separate vendors. Our findings are as follows:
​1)Claypot Foochow Mee Sua (RM25+): This dish was the most disappointing of our selections. It lacked the characteristic and expected aroma of red wine, offering a one-dimensional and overwhelmingly salty flavor profile. The high sodium content made it difficult to consume more than a few bites.

​2)Wanton Mee Soup with Dumplings (RM17+): The dumplings were satisfactory; however, the wanton noodles had a powerful and unpleasant alkaline taste, which completely overpowered the broth and other components. This issue significantly impacted the overall enjoyment of the dish.

​3)Fried Oyster Omelette (RM19.90): This dish was a poor value for its price. The portion was remarkably small, containing only five tiny, pre-boiled oysters. The omelette itself was bland and lacked the rich, savory flavor one would expect from a proper fried oyster omelette.
​In summary, Hutong Food Court offers small portion sizes at a premium price. The quality of the dishes we sampled was subpar, lacking the authenticity and flavor that are hallmarks of true Malaysian street food.",101673693757173449158,ChIJW9-tVyk2zDERU_D7NwNI_f4_101673693757173449158,2025-09-20 13:55:07,Kuala Lumpur,restaurant,restaurant_general,Monday: 10:00AM-9:30PM | Tuesday: 10:00AM-9:30PM | Wednesday: 10:00AM-9:30PM | Thursday: 10:00AM-9:30PM | Friday: 10:00AM-9:30PM | Saturday: 10:00AM-9:30PM | Sunday: 10:00AM-9:30PM,10:00AM-9:30PM,10:00AM-9:30PM,10:00AM-9:30PM,10:00AM-9:30PM,10:00AM-9:30PM,10:00AM-9:30PM,10:00AM-9:30PM,Lot 10 Hutong,negative,False,0.7584

We asked if they can split the bills since we are a big group. The waitress said they can only split to 2, so I asked for a pen so that I can tell her which to split and while I took the pen from her and the bill, my friend who sat next to me couldn’t hear us with the loud music , he took out his card and the waitress without waiting for me , took his card and just swipe the full amount. He ended up paying for everyone… some of us are not local, and doesn’t have cash so it would be difficult to do transfers. That’s why we wanted a split. She could have been patient and wait.

1. Nei Sooru with Mutton Thanni Kurma
The nei sooru had no ghee aroma or flavor — it tasted like plain rice. The mutton kurma was thin, watery, and lacked any real taste. For over RM30, the portion was very disappointing: a small bowl with just three pieces of mutton, mostly bone, and the meat wasn’t tender. Hard to understand how this dish gained so much praise.

2. Karupatti Halwa
This was the biggest letdown. The texture was dense and hard, almost like dodol — I could literally stand a spoon in it. Taste-wise, it was overwhelmingly sugary (felt like 95% sugar) with no balance of karupatti flavor. If you want proper karupatti halwa, I’d recommend trying Mulaga Restaurant instead.

3. Mutton Kola Urundai

Service: horrendous. Arrogant people. From booking of event till day of event, nothing is right. Slow response to messages, missed a serving of food, staff lack of attention and slow service. One of the item (deep fried tofu) no stock since days ago but no one from the restaurant informed us, until on the event day itself. They replaced with tofu claypot but served on a flat plate.

Food:
- Sotong Sambal is spicy and tasty but a bit hard to chew tho.
- The deep fried fish in soy and garlic sauce is tasty, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
- Buttered prawn's egg floss was crispy and well seasoned.

Let's not mention the other food we ordered (total 10 items).

The worse taste award goes to their Chinese fried rice. At RM22, it's definitely no value for money. It's totally bland. Even a pack of Adabi fried rice taste so much better. Doesn't look tempting at all. And this is the item which they overlooked from our paid menu. Can see it's a rush job to cook when everyone almost going home.

Environment: Honestly, with an open space like that, they need to be very alert that stray cats and dogs ""frequently visits"" the restaurant. It's extremely unhygienic as the cat was sitting comfortably at the chairs. They should at least wipe clean the dirt and bacteria.

Tonight was very different. I arrived around 9:40pm and was told it was fully booked, even though many tables were empty. I was seated at the back but told I had to leave by 10pm. When I asked if I could move to the bar after that, I was told the bar was also “fully booked.” My food arrived late, and just after I finished eating at 10:51pm, I was asked to move again because the table was “reserved at 11pm.” By then, I had lost any appetite to stay.

As I walked out, there were still plenty of empty tables.

Overall in my humble opinion... this shop has been just too hyped up.
If you are planning to go... Please LOWER your expectations. Thank God I did not go there hungry.
They need to get staffs who speak basic English or malay or Tamil.. They can understand or speak neither. Every thing we asked they jus sed ok or nod with no reply. So I can't fully say poor service cause they are trying to understand you and serve.
They did come n ask if everything was fine and all order arrived.
The food was overall average.
The best tasting was the alapuzha squid briyani.. Which was at a whopping rm59.
That's just too much for a shop in nowhere batang Kali.
The other bamboo chicken n mutton briyani tasted very very ordinary. As mentioned by other reviewers it's nowhere close to the spices and taste you expect from briyani. There was practically no curd in the raita.. A dry onion side dish.
The so called premium coffee and chai was a rip off with dramatic presentation...
The chai tasted like benadryl mixed with tea n chocolate. Nauseously sweet.
The coffee was very sweet as well tasted like a 3 in 1 mixture.

What topped it was refusal to provide hot water. I understand you want to make money from your drinks thus you don't want to provide warm/plain water but I requested for hot water for my son as he was not well. I can buy mineral water from shop.. Where else can I get hot water? You can make hot green tea but can't provide hot water? Who are you trying to scam?

And yeah i will neva step into this shop ever again.
Total paid was 178 for 5 dishes n 3 drinks n 2 water bottles

I think you can walk in to any shops in sentul or Brickfields and get a much better experience of briyani whether being Bamboo or not. For a cheaper price.

The food was delivered in such an awful, messy, and unappetizing manner — honestly, even my pet at home gets served better than this.

What’s even more shocking was the response when I called the restaurant directly. Instead of taking accountability or even attempting to resolve the issue, I was told, ""We can't do anything because Grab has a monopoly in the market.""

Seriously? That's possibly the lamest excuse I've heard from any F&B business. If you are unable to maintain a basic standard in how your food reaches customers, perhaps it's better to stop offering delivery altogether rather than pushing the blame and washing your hands off the responsibility.

Food delivery isn't just about taste — it's also about presentation, care, and respect for customers paying for your service. Blaming the delivery platform doesn't take away from the fact that the food left your kitchen in that state.

Rest assured — this is the first and last time I’ll be ordering from here. There are plenty of other places that take pride in their food from kitchen to doorstep

*On your response to my review above*

""Wow, what a beautifully worded apology — almost poetic! I’m genuinely impressed by how much care you’ve put into saying you’ll improve things. If only half that effort had gone into actually preparing or delivering the food, maybe we wouldn't be here.

Good thing is they offer lunch sets, food tasted o...k.... (I won't tell you you can have one of the best Nasi Lemak that makes a tiger fly, right across the street).
Bad thing is, it took one hour to get the food served! Not only that service was slow, they basically leave you and your requests unattended (hopefully it's not by choice), yet still charge 10% of service charge!

Instead of dining in a regular restaurant, we decided to try out the food court for some variety. Unfortunately, the experience didn’t quite meet expectations.

1st stop: Thai Cuisine stall
Ordered the Pattaya Fried Rice — it was underwhelming. The rice wasn’t fully wrapped in the egg, and the overall taste was quite plain and lacking depth. It felt more like a rushed attempt than an actual dish.

2nd stop: Yong Tau Foo
Picked peria, terong, fuyong gulung, pok segi tiga, and siew pak choy. Sadly, the peria and terong were undercooked, and the curry was oily with a very subdued flavor. It didn’t feel hearty or satisfying.

3rd stop: Melayu & Padang stall
We had nasi putih, ayam madu, and telur dadar. While the taste was okay, the portion was small and the price didn’t justify it. Definitely felt overpriced for what we got.

I appreciate the idea of offering various stalls to cater to different cravings, but in this case, the quality of food and the pricing just didn’t match up.

Gua Lepak at Taman Bolton is an okay place to chill with friends, especially if you’re looking for something casual and laid-back. The ambience is pretty standard — nothing too fancy, but it gets the job done if you’re not too picky.

Food-wise, it’s a mixed bag. Some items are quite tasty, while others are just average. Portion sizes are reasonable for the price, but don’t expect anything extraordinary. Service can be slow during peak hours, and not all staff are equally attentive, so a bit of patience is needed.

The seating area is quite spacious, which is a plus, but cleanliness can be inconsistent depending on the crowd. Parking might be a challenge during busy times, especially in the evenings.

There were hardly any proper vegetarian options, apart from a Malaysian dessert stall and a China Kitchen stall.

We tried the Egg Fried Rice with vegetables from China Kitchen (RM10 per plate). It came with a “soup” that tasted like salty water, and the rice itself had a strong stench of old eggs. It was soggy, tasted cheap and stale, and was honestly inedible - my mum refused to eat after one bite.
We left the food and told the stall to keep the plate. Definitely the biggest waste of money.

We also ordered drinks from Uncle Kopi, but they messed up the order and served overly sweet, thick kopi susu instead of kopi O. We had to order ice elsewhere and and add in it separately just to make it drinkable.

The only decent stall was the place that served Chee Cheong Fun which had a variety of light Malaysian desserts. Their Onde-Onde was actually delicious (I’ve attached the photo below for your reference as this was the only good thing for me there).

Overall, the food court was dark, had no nice vibe, and even the cleanliness was questionable (broom and cleaning supplies were left out in the open).

I tried the food here and honestly was disappointed. The taukuang lacked the fried taste and felt raw, the chicken was less marinated and tasted bland, and the kuah was watery with very little flavour. The only items I enjoyed were the cabbage and boiled egg – those were decent.

On the positive side, the Teh O Ais was refreshing and nice. The total came to RM16 (food + drink), which I feel is not worth it considering the quality.

The atmosphere feels lively and open, with a mix of stalls offering local and international cuisines. However, while the selection looks appealing at first glance, the overall quality varies quite a bit from stall to stall.

One of the highlights for me was the fresh coconut water. It’s incredibly refreshing, especially on a hot day, and has that distinct pandan-like aroma that gives it a naturally sweet and fragrant twist — something quite special compared to the usual coconuts you find elsewhere. On the other hand, the stall serving Chinese food was quite disappointing. The dishes lacked seasoning and depth of flavor, coming across as bland and uninspired. It felt like a missed opportunity, considering how flavorful Chinese cuisine can be when done right.

The fish and chips, however, were surprisingly decent. The fish was crispy on the outside, flaky on the inside, and paired well with the tartar sauce. It’s a safe option if you’re unsure of what to try. That said, prices here are definitely on the higher side — likely due to the tourist traffic in the area.

We also tried the Nyonya Sago Gula Malacca, but it was rather underwhelming. The sago itself was bland, and since the gula malacca could not be absorbed or properly dipped through the sago, the overall flavour was lacking. A touch of sweetness in the sago itself might have balanced it better.

I’d like to clarify a few points for Anamika:

Firstly, the agreed time of 3:00 PM—well past regular lunch hours—was not imposed by us but offered by your team, with a choice between 11:00 AM or 3:00 PM. Due to our travel schedule, we opted for the 3:00 PM slot. So, the concern about interrupting your lunch crowd does not quite apply here.

This is not about who recommended your restaurant or the timing. I am simply stating facts and presenting a photo of the food served at RM35 per person. I’m leaving it to the public to decide if the value matches what was delivered. I do not expect a further response from Anamika, as I believe the discussion is now conflicted.

To be fair, I acknowledge that the coffee, payasam, and mango pachadi were well received. However, the main dishes fell short of expectations, especially for the price point. Also, we did not request to be served; we could have easily helped ourselves since we paid for the full amount. The way it played out made it seem as though we were receiving food as a favour, when in fact it was fully paid for.

Additionally, there was a significant amount of food left over, which to me indicates dissatisfaction with quality—not quantity. I also paid separately for the two vegetarian meals, so I don’t believe it's appropriate for you to bring that up in your explanation.

The fact that something as basic as papadams had to be specially requested, despite the RM35 per head cost, also says a lot. I won’t be engaging further in a back-and-forth. I’ll let the public judge based on the facts and the pictures of what was served.

Additionally, I’ve shared my feedback with the relevant consumer authorities in Malaysia, who are currently monitoring pricing practices in the F&B sector. Let them assess whether this is acceptable and fair to the wider public.

Just for the record: the mutton had a strong odour, and the chicken—described as sambal—resembled and tasted more like kurma. These are honest reflections of what was experienced.

No more response is required from yourself.",109891248909888074291,ChIJkf59eZvDSjARb_oSm-DEhFQ_109891248909888074291,2025-07-30 04:07:59,Penang,restaurant,restaurant,Monday: 8:00AM-9:30PM | Tuesday: 8:00AM-9:30PM | Wednesday: 8:00AM-9:30PM | Thursday: 8:00AM-9:30PM | Friday: 8:00AM-9:30PM | Saturday: 8:00AM-9:30PM | Sunday: 8:00AM-9:30PM,8:00AM-9:30PM,8:00AM-9:30PM,8:00AM-9:30PM,8:00AM-9:30PM,8:00AM-9:30PM,8:00AM-9:30PM,8:00AM-9:30PM,Anamika Spice Kitchen,negative,False,0.9891

The coffee, which I was expecting to be the highlight, was lukewarm and bland. For a place that prides itself on its brews, this was a major letdown.

The ambiance was also disappointing. The seating was uncomfortable, and the overall vibe didn’t feel very welcoming. It was crowded and noisy, which made it hard to relax and enjoy my drink.

First, the Tandoori Biryani was a disaster. The rice was dry, lacked any real flavor, and tasted like it had been reheated multiple times.

As for the Peach Tea, I expected something refreshing, but instead, I got an artificial-tasting, overly sweet drink that felt like it came from the cheapest powdered mix available.

The worst part? The food was so bad that I couldn’t even finish it. Imagine paying RM37.20 and leaving the restaurant still hungry and disappointed.

Fried rice is supposed to be comforting, flavorful, and satisfying, but this was the complete opposite.

I couldn’t even finish half the plate, and that says a lot because I usually don’t waste food. It felt like they just threw it together without even tasting it first. If you’re going to brand yourself as the “king” of fried rice, the least you could do is make sure the rice itself is edible. Instead, this was a disgrace to fried rice lovers everywhere.

The whole experience left me frustrated because New World Park has plenty of good stalls, but this one really fell short. Honestly, I would not recommend this to anyone.

The Good:
1) Opens 24 hours.
2) Crowded even at night.
3) Got indoor and outdoor seatings, and the seatings is not too close to each other.
4) The prices is standard for a Mamak restaurant.
5) Serves all kind of dishes almost 24 hours.
6) Good selection of Nasi Kandar side dishes, until late night.

The Bad:
1) The food tastes, for me, not the best (tried Nasi Goreng Ayam; was smushy and bland).
2) The ambient sound is pretty noisy, because the plaza is quite busy in the morning (lots of service centres & banks located in that area), and even in late night from the laughter of insensitive groups of people dining there.

Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed by an uncle who provided great service, explaining the menu thoroughly and taking our orders efficiently. We ordered two meals along with a side of Gobi Manchurian (vegan).

The food itself was fine, but we couldn’t finish everything. When I asked a lady (who I believe might be the manager or director) to pack the leftover Gobi Manchurian for takeaway, her response was both surprising and disappointing. She mentioned that they don’t bring food back to the kitchen to pack leftovers and handed me a small burger box and a plastic bag, expecting us to pack the food ourselves.

I found this approach unprofessional and felt it lacked basic customer service. As a paying customer, I believe it’s reasonable to expect assistance with packing leftovers, especially in a dine-in setting. Her tone and attitude didn’t help the situation either, leaving a sour impression.

While the initial service was pleasant, this incident overshadowed our experience. It’s a shame, as small gestures of hospitality can make a big difference in maintaining a restaurant’s reputation.

Unfortunately, the experience was disappointing, and I feel compelled to share my feedback—not to criticise for the sake of it, but with the hope that improvements can be made, especially for such a well-known and established brand in Malaysia.

I completely understand the F&B industry is going through a tough time, and manpower shortage is a real challenge. My comments here are made with that in mind, and out of genuine concern for the customer experience.

Here’s what happened during my visit:
1.	Lack of staff presence – When I arrived, there was no one at the cashier or in the dining area to greet or seat us. We had to wait without knowing what to do next.
2.	Slow and uncoordinated food service – One of the food orders arrived and was almost finished before the rest of the items (two other dishes and drinks) were even served. The system showed the items as “prepared,” but clearly, they were not brought out in time, likely due to lack of manpower.
3.	Quality of food – The salmon bento was disappointing: the salmon didn’t seem fresh, the flavour was bland, and the rice was cold.
4.	Udon had a similar issue—it felt like it was left sitting for too long before reaching our table, as the temperature and texture were off.

5. The tablet being used to order food is oily.

6.	Payment process – Again, we had to wait at the counter because no one was there to attend to us, adding to the frustration.

I say all this not to be harsh, but because I believe Sushi King is capable of much better. It’s a recognised brand with a good reputation, and I hope the management at Ipoh Parade can take this feedback seriously and make the necessary adjustments.

Customers want to support local outlets, especially during hard times, but basic service quality and food freshness must still be maintained.",100640626647683556278,ChIJd9OxKVntyjERqlu5Hmqoc6A_100640626647683556278,2025-05-18 12:16:34,Perak,restaurant,restaurant,Monday: 10:00AM-10:00PM | Tuesday: 10:00AM-10:00PM | Wednesday: 10:00AM-10:00PM | Thursday: 10:00AM-10:00PM | Friday: 10:00AM-10:00PM | Saturday: 10:00AM-10:00PM | Sunday: 10:00AM-10:00PM,10:00AM-10:00PM,10:00AM-10:00PM,10:00AM-10:00PM,10:00AM-10:00PM,10:00AM-10:00PM,10:00AM-10:00PM,10:00AM-10:00PM,Sushi King Ipoh Parade,negative,False,0.9485

Really authentic south Indian food and the traditional touch of serving it on banana leaf was perfect. Prompt service too. But why I gave 3 star? Two Banana leaf meal is RM9 each which comes with rice, vege and rasam. Masala Chicken and Chili Chicken side order is RM8 each. Limau Kosong is RM4. Bru Coffee served on glass is RM4. Total bill RM42 for 2pax. We were a bit shocked because it is a canteen in school compound in Ipoh. This is not KL. It would be nice if the price adjusted to match its surrounding. It’s not exactly a luxury restaurant. Not many people can afford this. And one more thing, the bru coffee is terrible. Tasted like 3 in 1 coffee. Really is a nice meal. No doubt. I will definitely go again but i’m giving honest comment.

Update 1 STAR: I went again for dinner with friends. Omg! How regretful I am to have brought my friends there. There were no banana leaf meal at night. We had to order other things on menu like naan, palak paneer and briyani. The food came like some kids meal size. I can’t believe they charge you a handful and serve you such tiny servings.

Celebration. My uncle came 2 weeks ago to order some special dishes and there were 17 of us. We were given 2 tables of 9 and 8 person respectively. since the big table could only manage of group of 13. When we arrived at the restaurant, some car parks were reserved for us so that was handy since we had old people with us.  When we got into the restaurant, my Uncle was disappointed that we weren’t given a room for our private function. We were seated at the big hall. It took another 25 mins before the first dish arrived. It was the sea cucumber with abalone and other stuffs like water chestnut. The sea cucumber while seems a bit tougher than usual but still ok. The taste was good as there were abalone that came with it.  After the first meal, it took another 15 mins before the suckling pig was served. The dish was garnished with some steam buns and spring onions. To my disappointment, the suckling pig has a very strong gamy taste. The steam buns were not as soft as I wished it to. It was kind of felt like the bun had a dense texture. The third dish was the baked crab with salt and pepper. The first bite I had when I tasted it was salt. It was just too much! Luckily the crab meat was fresh and soft to save the dish. Then came the 2.5kg of Sultan fish. My table has only 8 people and imagine we had to eat the whole fish. It was way too big for the 8 of us and the soya sauce again was too salty to my liking. Kind of spoil the taste of the fish. I bet the chef never considered the number of dishes we had ordered and also the number of people seated on the table.  Kind of felt like a ripped off. We ended up packing 1/3 of the fish home. What a shame! By the time we finished the fish, we already so full and no appetite to eat the rest. The big head prawn in supreme sauce came after that. This was really sinful with the black caramelized supreme sauce. I found it too sweet and the prawn were overcooked and the fresh was very tough. What a way to spoil the big prawn! The stirred fried lotus stem with bangkuang, snow peas and cashew nuts was served soon after. The dish was kind of blend and I hardly taste any taste except the bangkuang which was a bit sour which was unusual. This was definitely not one memorable dish for the night. The last dish was the char siew noodles which represented the longevity noodles served for any birthday celebration. It turned out to be another disappointment where the noodles were very overcooked and lost it bounciness. I would gave this a pass too! Then the desserts were served, first was the longevity buns with lotus seed paste. Second came the mochi with peanuts and lastly the dragon fruits with sago sweet soup. We were just overwhelmed with the amount of food and feeling too full. The chef should have advised the host on the amount of food ordered if it was too much. They could have suggested the 2 tables shared one 2.5 kg of fish instead of having 2 x 2.5kg fish per table.  Instead of feeling happy and satisfied, we were disappointed with the food quality and the amount of food served was just insane. The bill came out to a whopping rm3100’per table which was shocking. I don’t think I would ever come back again for the poor quality and service given.",111637455454109007705,ChIJydSgpGTsyjERymAMIIH9g_c_111637455454109007705,2025-03-23 16:00:28,Perak,restaurant,restaurant,"Monday: 11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30-10:30PM | Tuesday: 11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30-10:30PM | Wednesday: 11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30-10:30PM | Thursday: 11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30-10:30PM | Friday: 11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30-10:30PM | Saturday: 11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30-10:30PM | Sunday: 11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30-10:30PM","11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30PM-10:30PM","11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30PM-10:30PM","11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30PM-10:30PM","11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30PM-10:30PM","11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30PM-10:30PM","11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30PM-10:30PM","11:30AM-2:30PM, 5:30PM-10:30PM",Super HLT Restaurant Ipoh Sdn Bhd,negative,False,0.9832

Food:
Drinks needs real improvement. Sugar level is still high after kurang manis request. Teh Ais powder is lausy and seems like recycle type.
I personally think the roti canai dough is little too thick and need to be refined when making it. The food is exposed and cold by evening. Not fresh.

Service:
Overall reasonably fair service but orders are not accurate when you receive the food. Something is always missing. Workers need to be on the alert. Little sloppy.

Ambience & Cleanliness:
Poor cleanliness. Walls and floor are all sticky. Need to do a proper clean up. Stickers all over the place. Can drinks are all over the place, messy area. Ambience surely not good. If it rains then you get a cool breeze coming in kalau tidak bau asap dari gas masak. Ventilation need to improve.

Some dishes were passable — the Western and popiah were alright. Others really missed the mark. The stingray was especially strange, drowned in a strong Indian curry flavour that just didn’t work.

Service
The service was quite disappointing. We made a booking 4–6 hours in advance, but when we arrived around 8.30pm, we still had to wait a long time for our food. Waiting is fine, but after 40 minutes, we noticed walk-in customers (without reservations) being served within 10 minutes. This made us question the purpose of making a booking in the first place.

2. Food
The food quality did not meet expectations. The fish was undercooked, and even other customers around us commented on the same issue. I also found fish skin in my dish, which made the experience less enjoyable.

3. Cashier
The cashier on duty on 16 Aug 2025 could improve on customer service skills. When I shared feedback with the intention of helping to improve, the response I received was an unpleasant expression, which made me feel unappreciated as a customer.

Final Note
This was my first visit, and unfortunately, it will also be my last.

We came there a bit early. They said they will only open at 12noon. Understandable, we waited. We enter at 12:05. It was our first time. 35rm per pax without drinks and the food you get is as per the photo plus the noodles that we did not try. Other restaurants you can have so much veggies plus hot & cold drinks.

By the time we were inside, we waited for another 12 mins to get the food. The lady standing there by the counter was busy looking at her phone only😅 It feels as if  she was pissed that we came early🤣
She was ordering the other guy (who btw was busy making the straw for the drinks) in bringing food to us. That’s one thing that spoils the atmosphere. When the service crew doesn’t make u feel welcome and feels like they don’t want you in their restaurant. Where is the hospitality and warmth in the service. She explained how is the system in ordering in the restaurant, especially when we want some refill.

I went to another korean restaurant in Kota laksamana , it was 31rm only (or 32) for the BBQ grill with variety of side dishes. Although it was self-service, they keep checking if our table needs refill for the meat. They were very polite and welcoming. Plus the food is very authentic.

The takoyaki was not hot (it was just warm), teopokki is so low quality. The sauce is so watery. The fried chicken are basically all same . They just added different sauces. Most of the dishes are very filling like the noodles, the rice, the teopokki and  the fries. We ordered 1 drink and it was sooooo sweet.
Overall, we tried it to just check the place and will never come back . Hence, will not recommend this place. I find it actually a ripped off.

Just like many comments, the place looks deserted. We were the first costumers and the lady couldn’t even wish a simple “hello” or “Welcome”.

My brother and I ordered the chicken biryani. To be honest, it was one of the most underwhelming chicken biryanis I’ve ever had. It lacked the spiciness, aroma, and rich flavor that a good biryani should have. It just tasted like very ordinary rice to me. The restaurant could definitely put in more effort to improve this dish.

Service could also be faster. As for the ambience, it was just okay and could definitely be improved.

The ambience is really nice — cozy and romantic — but that’s about the only good thing we can say. For the price (over RM150 per person), we definitely expected more.

We couldn’t even choose our own drinks or desserts. They just served us two kinds without asking, and the drinks were really watered down and didn’t taste premium at all. We don't even know what drinks we would get.

The food was another disappointment. All four courses came almost at the same time, so by the time we got to the mains, they were already lukewarm. The lamb flap barely had any gravy and became jelak really quickly, while the mango smoked duck was okay but way too salty towards the end. The sup tulang was okay, but not amazing. The only dish we actually enjoyed was the tiramisu.

To top it off, the waiter promised us a “Happy Anniversary” message on our desert plate, but even that didn’t happen.

12:25 PM – Ordered a Soondubu Jjigae Lunch Set
12:48 PM – Food arrived

Experience:

1. I stood in front of the counter for like 5 minutes, but no one bothered to serve me.

2. The staff’s attitude was horrible. Treated me like I was disturbing him, and had zero patience while I was ordering. Somemore, the staff can't really communicate well in Malay or English. I also don’t know what he was trying to say while ordering.

4. The place is super hot, hard to breathe properly. Feels like not enough oxygen inside the restaurant. And ya, no aircon – just standalone fans for airflow.

5. The ""free"" green tea is completely tasteless. Honestly, if the tea got no taste, better just give normal drinking water lah.

6. Food presentation looks okay, but the side dishes are ridiculously little. The green onion not even fresh, and the enoki mushroom was RAW! (Can refer to the photo.)

7. The food taste... okay lah? Maybe because I was too hungry after waiting so long. (Disclaimer: only one customer in front of me somemore.)

Conclusion:
There are many better options in Paradigm Mall JB. MyeongDong Topokki at Paradigm Mall JB is definitely not the place for a good dining experience. Dear management, please take note of this. Looking at the Google reviews, I’m clearly not the only one complaining.

Imagine lah — if someone brings a girl here for a date, wah, what a bad experience. Might even cause trauma for real.

Total price : 240 ringgit ( including the lemonade with enzyme)

I didnt fabricated anything, it is exactly as how it went.

Went on Saturday 19th April 2025, around 12.30pm. Clearly almost everywhere is crowded because it's lunch hour.

Went in as there was no queue, but the restaurant was fairly crowded, and stepped outside to wait for someone to perhaps notice us and let us in since I didn't wanted to just barge in.

But I saw a worker but definitely an auntie from my perspective using phone and wasn't sure watching something or what, but heads down and engrossed on it while manning the entrance. 🤔 so I just approached and asked if there was table for two, which a lady guided us.

So we sat down and choose the menu and went onto order. Clearly understaffed. There are around 20 tables with 2-3 staff serving and taking orders.

So we had to caught the attention of the young female staff to take our order and she wrote it down and went to take another person's order and we waited afterwards.

Past 20 minutes no one came down to check on us or serve our food. So given that I've been in FnB, I gave the benefit of doubt, and just checked in with the same lady to perhaps pass us the order invoice and she told her she will get it but another 10 minute she breeze past us and didn't give us anything.

I don't mean to say anything bad, but it got me wandered, what could be the problem.

So we got the guy staff instead to check, and he got back to us stating that we didn't order anything and asked who took our order and when we shared, he just shook his head, so I guess he knew it as well.

Then we got our food.

As you can see in the photo, I got to say, the soup good. Everything else, pretty much suck. I gotta be honest. This place has some great soup and really I feel it's worth it. But everything else it's very questionable.

Also, it's seems specialised in soup, yet only when we are ready to order, the staff tell us 80% of the soup wasn't available? And it was only 12.30pm so if most of it is not available, what are they selling exactly???

Usually in msia, I don't get such unpleasant experience in terms of food, but this place wasn't beyond acceptable.

You can be the judge, and if you want soup, I'd recommend, but everything else, haha...it's entirely up to you.

(review for main course, not their bakeries)

Have been wanting to try this place a for a long time. Before entering the cafe, already accepted the fact it’s going to be an expensive place given the location and the atmosphere but the foods are just disappointing.

The Cajun Chicken Aglio Olio, totally disappointed the moment the dish is served. Looks like they just throw the chicken on the top, nothing like shown. For the taste, hmm it tastes below average, already asked for less salt but the pasta still tasted v salty. The chicken looks & taste like the average  chicken.

RM38 Nasi lemak - served with overcooked chicken, so dry that we didn’t even finish. My brother commented it seems like an overnight chicken which has been re-fried multiple times. Tho the rice has a v nice fragrance. This price point I would rather go to orixxtxl kxxi or the txxst for nasi lemak.

I love hojicha, but I felt like the sweetness has overpowered the significance taste of hojicha. (This could be personal preference)

Last words, main courses are really disappointing however it seems like this place is famous for bakery which we didn’t order any. If you want to come maybe go for their bakeries first.

It’s a well-known Indian eatery in the area, and although it may not serve what I would call authentic Indian food, I notice that many Indian locals frequent the place.

The restaurant is best known for a few dishes, including their Indian set lunch, where customers choose dishes from a display counter, and roti starting at 3:30 p.m., along with tandoori chicken and naan. As for drinks, their previous signature beverages included ""blu"" (a mix of coffee and milk tea), coffee, and milk tea. However, it’s important to note that some of the drinks are not freshly made-to-order. Instead, they seem to pre-boil the tea and store it in containers before mixing with milk and serving it.

During my latest visit, after finishing my meal, I was sipping on a milk tea (teh tarik) when I noticed something unusual in the drink. At first, I thought it was a tea leaf, but after spitting it out, I discovered it was a fly. I immediately reported this to a waiter, but unfortunately, I received no response. When I later informed the supervisor (also acting as cashier) while paying the bill, I was told the fly may have gotten in when the drink was prepared. While I didn’t ask for a replacement or refund, for obvious reasons, I would have appreciated a better response or at least an apology.

I like the beef patty as it was juicy and tender. The bun was soft too. But, as I read the menu, the gourmet and stuffed cheese doesn’t have much difference.

It was just one slice. And the sauce was wayyyy too sour to my liking. I’m so sorry, but the sourness was too overwhelming for me. Maybe I should have ordered another menu.

I asked whether it is halal when I first arrived. And the staff said “of course it is halal”, but they didn’t put any certification, so I had to look it up online.

We asked about what is beef coney sauce and the staff answered “it’s a beef sauce” 😅

We asked whether it contains any nuts as my friend has nut allergies. He just said that it doesn’t contain any nuts without providing further info, so we had to ask each ingredient.

I completely understand that people can be tired or have personal problems. But, it’s not that I did something wrong, right?😅 I made sure I asked politely. I have never complained about customer service. I am not asking to be treated politely. But, please just treat me the way you want to be treated as a person🥹

I would like to raise a concern regarding the customer service experience at your establishment. During my recent visit, I encountered a staff member whose attitude was notably unprofessional — responding to customer inquiries with a rude tone, displaying a sour expression, and even giving unpleasant looks to customers.

As a customer, I come to enjoy the service, not to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.

I’ve been a regular customer at KAKA for many years, which shows how much I’ve appreciated their food, presentation, reasonable prices, and value for portion sizes.

However, I had a very disappointing experience last night, 7th October 2025.

As a regular, I know the café usually doesn’t accept phone orders. But due to our long-standing trust, they accepted my second phone order after many years of dining there.

At 8:50 PM, I called to place an order for 4 dishes while I was still at the office (approximately a 7-minute drive, 4.1km away). At 9:08 PM, while I was just 1km away and heading there,

I received a call from the owner. In an arrogant tone, she said in Bahasa:

“Satgi kalau makanan sejuk, jangan dok salahkan kami na.”
(Translation: “If the food is cold later on, don’t blame us, ok!”)

Honestly, I was shocked. Where is the courtesy? That completely ruined my dinner mood.

When I arrived one minute later, I saw a staff member placing the 4 dishes on a table—perfectly timed at just 18 minutes after the order was placed (which is unusually fast, considering it normally takes 40 minutes to an hour, depending on how busy it is).

The owner approached me and apologized. I told her:
“You shouldn’t speak to a customer like that. I’ve been supporting your café for many years. If I couldn’t make it on time or had to cancel, you could’ve simply called me and even charged me. You know where my office is.”

Sadly, last night was my final dinner at KAKA.

If you’re coming, come for the scenery — not the food. Keep your expectations low when it comes to taste, quality, and portion size.

There were only 3 other tables besides us and 2 of them already had their food the table. We ordered the ramen with grilled chicken at 1.39pm. At 1.47 we were informed that the grilled chicken could take 6-7mins. At 2.20pm we still haven’t received our food so we enquired about the progress the waiter. He said that the order was still not ready. We asked to cancel the order so we could eat elsewhere but the waiter said orders cannot be cancelled once entered into the system and he then “recommended” we change to other dishes which would be faster. We then opted to switch to karage ramen since the waiter insisted that it could be served immediately. Not 5 minutes after, another waiter came and reprimanded us for attempting to change our order when “it’s almost done” because it’s “difficult to change in the system” despite it being recommended by themselves.

So in the end our food arrived at 2.30pm. The position was smaller than expected and the despite it not tasting too bad the whole experience leaves one wanting.

Goodluck trying to get the waiter’s attention.

Came here for anniversary dinner and thought to treat ourselves to the house special: sticky BBQ ribs. We also tried the truffles and caesar salad.

The ribs were the driest we ever had, with no gravy or sauce and was super bland. Wondering which part of it was sticky and it costs almost RM100.

The truffle fries had some burnt pieces of fries and the portion was smalller than the already small plate. The caesar salad was devoid of any complexity of flavours and were also super dry, served with a cold hard boiled eggs.

All the dishes that came out looked nothing like in the menu. Despite charging an exorbitant amount the dishes looked cheap, poorly garnished and presented. Not to mention the dirty cutleries being presented us, who knows if it was washed properly or is being reused.

This place used to be something, with a nice ambience and lighting. Now you eat under bright lights and wave your hand frantically to get the waiters attention. Nobody in the restaurant looked like theyre having a good time and bare in mind it’s a weekday night and not peak hour weekend.

Falling victim to their own greed of overcharging customers for a subpar experience, a total waste of RM200. If you want to celebrate something special, this is not the place.

The menu is quite vast offering multiple cuisines from fried rice to nasi lemak to local Mee tuaran(Chinese egg noodle).

Drinks are pretty standard but super low quality, beware of the sweetness and condensed milk.

They also have many confectionaries from bread to muffins, swiss rolls.

The service is as you would expect with counter pay & table service.

The atmosphere gives an authentic feel of local Sabah but we were constantly haggled by outsiders to purchase bread for them. Even after giving them some spare change(RM10 in total, yes multiple members from the same group kept coming), they will not stop haggling and eyeing us during our visit at the shop. We were frankly really appalled, just something to take note of while you are there.

The food that stood out positively to me was the basic minced meat Mee tuaran, pls do not order the seafood Mee tuaran as it was much less flavourful and plain compared to the basic ver for a much higher price..

Had the Lamb Varuval and fish and chips.
The guy attending told us the chef was new and it was his first day, maybe that was the issue.

Lamb Varuval meat was soft and fresh as promised and the flavour was quite reasonable but that's where it ends. Apparently this dish is supposed to be oily (the staff told us in retrospect). It was extremely oily, both the lamb dish and the rice. The excessive oil detracting from the other nice flavours. Some will love it,...

The lamb dish was approx 70% bone and lamb fat. Again there are those that will be stimulated by the thought of all that lamb fat...
See before and after photos. The one that looks messier is what's left after you pick out all the available protein. At RM 38+ it was very disappointing.

Fish Tom Yum: The soup was overly sweet — it tasted like a whole kilogram of sugar had been poured into it, which completely overpowered the traditional tom yum flavor.

Vegetables: The vegetables were far too salty and drenched in oil, making them unpleasant to eat.
Chicken: I ordered a chicken dish, but it never arrived. Despite there being hardly any customers, the restaurant still managed to miss the order.

Service:
The waiter seemed unmotivated and uninterested in their work. Service was very slow overall, even though the restaurant was not busy.

Atmosphere:
The surroundings of the restaurant are clean, and it benefits from a nice view of Mount Kinabalu. However, the tables were dirty and oily, which detracted from the overall dining experience.

The service of the place left much to be desired. It seems like everyone has a specific job or KPI and they are unwilling to do anything out of their scope. It took us almost 30 minutes just to order a can of coke until finally some foreign labourer who was the friendliest in the shop got us the drinks and apologised too.

Special mention about the aunty doing dumplings. She was rather rude as she just rudely throw some items that was apparently blocking her on our table. She could have told us nicely instead of just slamming it on our table. I have serious concerns on her hygiene too as she was preparing said dumpling without washing her hands. I cannot comment on her dumplings as I do not think I can stomach ordering from her.

However, when it came to the main highlight, the Signature Bamboo Briyani, it fell a little short of my expectations. While the dish was full of aromatic spices, it was under-seasoned and could use a touch more salt for balance. It would also be more pleasant if whole spices like cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaves were enclosed in a spice sachet, so they don’t end up mixed throughout the rice. Accidentally biting into them in every spoonful can be quite off-putting.

The mutton chunks, although flavorful, were not as tender as expected. A bit more time in a pressure cooker would make them melt-in-the-mouth and elevate the overall experience.

The sides also felt a little underwhelming for the price. Considering the restaurant is in the heart of an agro-produce area, the coleslaw, cucumber, and tomato portions could be more generous — a full scoop of coleslaw would make a big difference.

Used to drop by this shop for the last 20 years when coming g down from genting.  Their fish head curry and fried chicken was tasty.

However the last 2 visit was bad. The taste is not like it used to be and the fish head is just not as tasty or fresh as it used. Previous they used ikan merah head and now it's just a cheap fish ( not sure of the fish type) . The fish head tate bitter . The fried chicken also not as good as it used to be .

The fish head is rm75-90 and it's quite disappointing.

Firstly, the location is very far from skyavenue and first world hotel (this is nearer to genting grand hotel).

So it was quite a walk getting here in the early morning.

Next, we're here for breakfast. You can see from the photos, there's no food. You know what's for breakfast? Curry. And laksa. And Sambal. Lol. So if you dont prefer spicy foods, especially in the mornings, you can skip the long walk here cause the curry and laksa is so not worth it.

The only other foods i could recommend would only be the watermelon. It was tasty, had not a lot of seeds. The oranges are sour. So dont try it. ;) Oh, and the scrambled eggs and fried eggs are also awesome.

Warning : DO NOT try the hash browns and the waffle. Its all cold and hard lol.

Staff are ignorant and very noisy. The kitchen staff stand around talking loudly, like there's no noise from the guests, so you could hear all the yapping from the staff.
We were also graced with a cook from somewhere who was singing at the top of his lungs. (He was the only friendly one cause he said good morning to all the guests.)

Their sign literally says NO ENTRY. Lol. And the sign remained that way even after we finish with our breakfast. Shows how much effort the staff put into welcoming guests.

Now I've just checked - they r Known for scamming, pls check other reviews here - ppl have written about it....

This tilapia is NOT 1KG but u still charge 1kg despite confrontations...

I'm not some1 who leave a bad review for people much (you can check the profile) but I need to write this down so ppl will be wary of these low life scammers...

I was having the fish alone so I asked the person who took my order how heavy the tilapia was and she said its about 900g-1kg... A bit heavy for a single person but I thought  didn't really matter as the price was fair @ 40rm a kg... So I thought ok.

1st red flag - upon confirming the order I was looking at the aquarium and saw the live tilapias but thought they were small ones  looking like 800+-g so I went to ask the waitress and told her I saw small fishes and I want the small ones instead.. She said minimum 900-1kg anyway...
Giving them the benefit of doubt, I was thinking The small ones didn't look that heavy but I thought ok nvm let's see what they will be giving, maybe my eye sight is bad and inside aquarium look different...

So when they served the tilapia, I had a good look at it and quite sure it was around 800g MAX MAX 900g so I asked the lady that took my order how heavy it was and she said its 1kg sharp... I told her this cannot be 1kg and of course she said it was and took to spoon to scoop up the tail to show me that it was - I'm not sure why she did that because there wasn't much on the tail anyway. But I thought ok nvm just accept it ....... Its my word against theirs..

As I was eating the fish and scooping up the flesh and head, I became more and more sure this was not 1kg due to the 1) size of the head, 2) size of bone and structure and 3) collar bone and belly... 2nd red flag.

3rd red flag - So after finishing the fish, I went to pay the bill at the counter and at the same time I asked how heavy was the fish they will be billing me... I saw the bill and the lady said 1kg... I told her it's not possible that's 1kg. And she became defensive without even checking with the kitchen or check out the whole issue... She just snapped at me and said some nonsense which I still don't get it which was something like they deboned the fish..... And in my head, I still remember going thru the bones so wdf does she mean by they 去骨... I'm just thinking like you don't even bother to double triple  check and understand the whole situation and double triple confirm if there was no human error and u just responded to me in a defensive manner, it must be you have already been scamming like this for a long time..

Anyway, I decided to just pay and write this down... Because obviously they will argue that it's 1kg anyhow...

Frankly speaking, the fish was around 800g (a size of tilapia I am very very familiar with as this was my usual portion when I eat) and max max 900g, I still can accept and wouldn't have written this down...
But because u insist it was 1kg and was defensive without even checking properly, I know your place is a total scam.....

My bill and photo of fish for every1 to judge.... Look at the size of the head - it's as small as the serving spoon (勺子）.... Its not a lot of money, maybe a difference of 100-200g price (rm4-rm8), but in exchange for that, here is my honest review you earned for your scamming business...

BTW, I have whole tilapia THREE-FOUR times a week so I know roughly what the size is usually.. U cant fool every1...

Anyway, taste is bad too... Assam steam tasted just like cheap flavourings to make the sauce  and vege lack taste/flavour.. Soup was alright but nothing to shout about...

If this is one of the best Kulim had to offer, then this town probably hasn't much good eatery places. I don't usually rate nasi kandar of this nature, only in the rare circumstances of slim pickings or glowing  recommendations and this one justified my opinion, however unqualified that may be, that commercialized nasi kandar are usually mediocre at best. This one is just bad.

The ayam madu is sweet like they pour the entire pack of sugar in the pot. There is no flavour beyond sugary sweet, just a mild chilli heat without much spices and mildly seasoned. I'd say this sauce is even suitable for chee cheong fun. The chicken was also over fried and thus is very tough for something you'd cook in a watery sauce. The only thing good is their rice which is firm, oily and has proper spices. If only they'd put in as much effort in their chicken dish. The price should be within the town's standard but slightly higher than the more established neighboring Bukit Metajam.

The first time I visited, I ordered nasi goreng ayam, but my food arrived very late because the staff forgot my order. Not only was it delayed, but it was also packed for takeaway without me asking for it.

On my second visit, I ordered char kuey teow, and the same thing happened again — the staff forgot my order. By the time I asked at the counter, all my friends had already finished eating, and only then did the staff inform the kitchen to prepare my meal.

This repeated mistake is very frustrating as it shows a lack of attentiveness to customers.

Thanks for your reply, but I think it’s unnecessary to argue with customers who share honest feedback. I didn’t ask for compensation or replacement, I just wanted to highlight the hygiene and freshness issue so it can be improved. It’s understandable that solo diners get smaller tables, but placing customers outdoors where it smells rancid and has flies really affects the dining experience.

Food wise: First and foremost there's list of menus but only certain was available, but I do understand as I was here for dinner, maybe there's shortage on foods, idk??

I would like to raise a concern regarding the service my wife and I received at Sushi King Mydin Tunjong on 25th June 2025. We arrived at around 8:50 PM as my wife was craving sushi. The stated closing time is 10:00 PM, yet we were told by the staff that the outlet was already closed.

This was quite surprising, considering there were still empty tables, customers dining in, and plenty of food still available. When we asked if we could at least order takeaway, the staff replied, “Yes, but it will take a while,” in a rather dismissive tone.

I kindly urge the branch manager of Sushi King Mydin Tunjong to:

1. Take this issue seriously and investigate the matter.
2. Ensure there are enough staff members to serve customers until closing time.
3. Train staff to be courteous and professional, regardless of how close it is to closing time.

If someone is only working for the sake of getting paid, this kind of attitude will show. When you're paid a salary, you should work sincerely - that’s how your earnings become meaningful and blessed.

What was really disappointing was the service experience. With prices similar to some well-known satay spots in Kajang or Baung (nearby), we expected at least decent service. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. We ordered a hot dish (mee goreng), and it never arrived even after waiting for over an hour. Honestly, who takes an hour to cook mee goreng?

We followed up twice at the counter, and in the end, they refunded us. It’s not about the money—it’s about the time wasted and the mood it spoiled, especially when you’re just trying to enjoy a short vacation.

We waited another couple minute, the previous server just walked by as I literally said we wantes to order. Then we called them again, nothing. Obviously, no food to review as there were no orders taken beforehand too.

Please ensure to add more servers to take orders. Or , since the services uses tablets for orders, (with a pink case, and black strap) add those too :)

First, the steamed fish was shockingly thin, almost translucent. It felt like they were being incredibly stingy with the portion. It was a real struggle to get any substantial meat from it, which was surprising, as I’ve never encountered such a portion, even for just a few diners.

The oyster omelette was another letdown. The dish was overwhelmingly egg, with barely any oysters in sight. When I order an oyster omelette, I expect the oysters to be the highlight, not to have them hidden in an overcooked egg. It was clear they cut corners on the key ingredient.

The sweet and sour pork with the yam basket was likely the best dish of the meal, but even that had its flaws. The pork was decent, but the yam basket was a real disappointment. It lacked any crispness; instead, it was soggy and overly chewy, with a tough fried skin that was hard to enjoy. A yam basket should have a satisfying crunch, but this was completely missing.

The fried rice, however, was passable and didn't disappoint as much as the other dishes.

Overall, the meal fell far short of expectations, and considering the price, it’s certainly not worth it. I won’t be returning, though perhaps I’d consider trying other dishes if I did. Price is reasonable.

Drove and drove and drove... and missed the turning cos the signboards are soooooo bad! Had to make a massive u-turn and finally got to the parking.

Got there, sat down, and was attended to by a very polite gentleman. There's a lot of seating so take your pick. Just remember that if you sit near the river, you'll probably have to deal with screaming idiotic children playing. If you hate kids like I do, that's going to be a problem.

I got the nasi goreng Aina and the missus got the laksa Johor; we shared a cucur udang. Food finally came and it was definitely pretty... and that was it.

The fried rice was soooooo boring, and the missus said she's had better laksa at roadside stalls. The cucur udang was 1 prawn wrapped in a tonne of batter. Absolutely crap! Seems like this place gives more importance to figure than form; as long as it's pretty, it doesn't matter if it tastes atrocious.

The food? Genuinely good. But good food alone doesn’t make up for service that feels like an afterthought.

The staff consistently seem uninterested in the fact that customers exist. Even during non-peak hours, the pace is glacial and lack attentiveness

A few highlights from our recurring disappointment:

We’ve sat for nearly 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. Eventually, we gave up and placed our own orders at the counter. Takeaway orders? Also ignored. We waited, only to discover our food had been packed and abandoned at the counter. If this is meant to be self-service, a sign would be a revolutionary idea.

Ordered tandoori chicken, specifically thigh meat. It arrived late, after everyone else had finished and it was breast meat. The staff’s response? A laugh and a casual “change it.” Charming.

On 12 Oct 2025, while queuing, I was skipped over in favor of the person behind me. Apparently, I was somehow invisible.
Same day, a staff member began taking my drink order, then walked off mid-sentence when someone called him. No apology, no explanation. Another staff member had to step in. Basic courtesy seems optional.

And then there’s the billing. They don’t provide itemised bills by default. The one time I requested one, it turned into a full-blown ordeal. The staff member had to manually search and key in each item, and it took 10 minutes to produce a bill. Makes you wonder how the accounting works behind the scenes, if it works at all.

I initially gave this establishment a 5 start based on my 1st visit. But I changed it today and added this review.

Amos Curry House could be a standout spot. But right now, it’s a place with excellent food and service that feels like an afterthought.

When we arrived, there was a large group dining as part of a Christmas celebration. After being seated, we were neither greeted nor given a menu. I eventually had to go to the counter to collect the menu myself. Shortly after that, the staff noticed me and promptly served us bread.

We ordered a salad, three pasta dishes, and one salmon dish. It took about an hour for the food to arrive. Overall, the experience was just okay—nothing special or memorable.

Personally, I feel that the price increase is not justified given the portion size and the ingredients in the salad and pasta. With this price, it’s better to dine in a mall or hotel for buffet.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1.	Manage Walk-Ins During Busy Times
When hosting large group dinners, consider limiting walk-in customers to prevent service delays and long wait times due to understaffing.

2.	Enhance Dining Presentation
For the price being charged, provide a more refined setup, such as tablecloths, and have the staff arrange the cutlery for customers.

3.	Address Long Wait Times Proactively
Instead of simply apologizing for the one-hour wait, take action to improve the experience. Offer drinking water, refill the bread, or provide a small sharing dessert. These gestures would leave a more positive impression on customers.",101070744798348871130,ChIJaZdhqE2lyDERuPBeCdPX7aw_101070744798348871130,2024-12-15 13:42:34,Pahang,restaurant,restaurant,Monday: Closed | Tuesday: 6:00-10:30PM | Wednesday: 6:00-10:30PM | Thursday: 6:00-10:30PM | Friday: 6:00-10:30PM | Saturday: 6:00-10:30PM | Sunday: 6:00-10:30PM,Closed,6:00PM-10:30PM,6:00PM-10:30PM,6:00PM-10:30PM,6:00PM-10:30PM,6:00PM-10:30PM,6:00PM-10:30PM,La Casa Kuantan,negative,False,0.9753

The menu looked super tempting and we decided to try two different chicken-based burgers. And then…the wait began. Despite only having one table ahead of us (with four customers), we ended up waiting a full 30 minutes for our order.

When the burgers finally arrived, the presentation was on point, but taste-wise, it didn’t really hit the mark for us. The fried chicken overpowered everything else, felt like there wasn’t much flavour beyond that. Definitely felt like the burgers could’ve used a better balance or seasoning.

On the plus side, the cashier was friendly and had a very pleasant vibe. The place was clean, and parking wasn’t a hassle. Prices, though, were slightly on the higher end for what you get.

Probably the only wing specialist place in Ipoh, I was a customer since the pandemic, and looked forward to their wings, burgers and wraps freshly prepared in a plethora of flavours. Although a bit pricey, the uniqueness of the menu sort of justified it.

However, since the change in management last year (see their Facebook page), I detected a significant drop in quality in almost all aspects, and they're still spiralling. The choices of flavours have reduced to less than half; the chicken wings are small, dry, tough, and not fresh; and worst of all, the flavours themselves are not tasty anymore.

Smokin' Q was the best flavour. Sweet, salty, spicy and smoky all rolled into one. But today, just the richness of the sauce remains. The sauce is curiously bland and tasted worse than your generic barbecue sauce. For ""flavourholics"" this is not.

The restaurant is also in a mediocre state. The air-conditioning isn't working and it's warm even in the evening. The soft drinks aren't ice-cold. Gone too are the plastic gloves to wear while eating to keep your hands clean. And I can't even choose between blue cheese or ranch anymore!

Also known as Restoran Tepi Sungai, it was recommended by others on the internet. As it was the only seafood restaurant open for business at that time, we decided to give it a try.

The eating hall is actually located on the first floor instead of the ground floor, reachable from a flight of stairs. As we were the first customers, we got to pick the spot with the best view, overlooking the Sepetang River beneath us. Food ordering was pretty fast, and our food came quickly too.

We really liked the Blanched Cockles. They tasted fresh, and did not have the usual fishy taste that cockles have. They tasted great when mixed with minced garlic and chillies.

The Salted Egg Mantis Shrimp we ordered was not good at all. The meat was tough, dry, and it did not have the usual fragrance of salted egg. We doubted the freshness of the mantis shrimp. Overall, it was a disappointment.

We ordered the simple Steamed Crab, hoping to taste the crab without it being overwhelmed by sauces that are usually present in other cooking methods, which sometimes overpower the taste of the crabs themselves. However, the crabs were just so-so, lacking the natural sweetness of crab meat, and the dish came with one of the crabs missing one of its claws. There must be better choices for crabs elsewhere.

To complete the meal, we also ordered Stir Fried Malabar Spinach (清炒帝皇苗). As usual, I like my vege cooked simple, and simple is good.

We only ordered three main dishes: about eight prawns, three squids, and one medium-sized seabass. Along with some side dishes and drinks, the bill came up to RM250, which is completely unreasonable for the portion served.

On top of that, the food was not tasty and was served cold, as if it had been sitting out for some time before reaching our table. For a restaurant specializing in seafood, I expected fresh, flavorful dishes, but what we got was far below standard.

In my opinion, the price does not match the quality and the  quantity of food served. There are many better seafood places in Port Dickson that offer fresher food, larger portions, and more reasonable prices.

The restaurant boasts a wide array of kampung-style dishes, including popular choices like Gulai Lemak Cili Api, Asam Pedas, Sup Panas, Ikan Bakar, Kari, and an extensive selection of ulam-ulaman. It's certainly a spot with plenty of options to choose from.

For my meal, I opted for nasi putih with Ikan Pari Bakar, hati ayam and some vegetables. Unfortunately, the Ikan Pari Bakar was noticeably ""hancing"" (rancid) and inedible. I informed a waiter about the issue, and to their credit, they promptly replaced it with Ikan Kembung Bakar.

While the replacement dish was acceptable, the initial unpleasant experience with the rancid fish was quite off-putting and definitely left a lasting negative impression. Overall, I personally believe the taste of the food was just okay, nothing particularly outstanding.

In terms of pricing, I found it to be on the higher side for what was offered. Additionally, there's certainly room for improvement when it comes to the cleanliness of the establishment.

First impressions were good — the space was bright and airy, and not crowded during brunch hour. Menu offerings were fairly standard café fare, though prices seemed a little on the premium side.

We ordered the Big Breakfast, Farm Bake, Nasi Lemak BOMB, a few lemonades, and later added the viral tiramisu.

Big Breakfast – Disappointing. The bread wasn’t toasted, which made it soggy under the scrambled eggs. The salad had just two cherry tomatoes within the greens, and the portion included one hash brown wedge, a chicken sausage, two thin chicken slices, and some mushrooms. It lacked substance for the price. 2/5

Nasi Lemak BOMB – The rice was creamy with a nice pandan aroma. But the beef rendang was tough and the ayam goreng berempah was dry. Flavours didn’t come together well. 2/5

Farm Bake – This was the biggest letdown. We were told it would take 20–30 minutes. After 30 minutes, it still wasn’t ready. Eventually, we were told there was a kitchen issue, and were offered a complimentary cheesecake as compensation. The dish finally arrived almost an hour — essentially a shakshouka-style bake with just two lamb meatballs. Not worth the wait or price. We couldn’t even finish it. 1/5

Tiramisu – Marketed as “scoop all you can,” but the taste didn’t impress. The mascarpone mix felt diluted with cream and lacked that rich, punchy flavour. 2/5

Overall, this was a pretty underwhelming experience. The service was polite, but the food didn’t deliver — especially at the price point.

1. Service
The drink, the side dishes ordered are already served, but still have to wait some time for the rice to be served!

Please train your waiters to be gentle while serving food to customers! Not just pour on the banana leaf, the rice almost fall over to my pants!

I requested to add on rice and vegetables! I requested for 3 times!! 3 times!!! Felt like being ignored! I requested to 2 staffs, yet they failed to attend to my request within short time, I have to wait!

Secondly, am I being treated differently? The next table to me was attended so well by the waiters! And funny thing, they have the chicken 65 dish delivered to their table. While I making orders at the entrance, your staff told me all spice dishes are finished! Is this a lie? Is this how you treat your customers?

2. Drinks
I ordered a cup of hot Teh tarik, it is plain and tasteless! No tea aroma, no sweetness at all!

Last but not least, please learn how to operate your store from MidValley outlet! They served so well, that I had the urge to try again with other outlets! But unfortunately, it is an utterly disappointment for this outlet compared to MidValley!

Last, bill payment also takes time! I waited there in front of the cashier, and standing looking at him doing the dishes work, I tried to get his attention but failed, Haih!

I went there on Merdeka Day for dinner
We ordered the set- include steamed fish.
We waited more than 1 hour - nobody told us that we were to expect long waiting hour; we might not order if that was the case.

A jug of orange drink arrived first.
Then after 1 hour, the rice and other dishes ( except fish). Only the rice was hot. All dishes were cold. 🫠

The fish. We waited for another 15min.
Overall, not a happy experience for us.
If there were not enough chef, just let the customers know.
That is simple logic.

Not sure if the owner will read this. As I am not the only one complained about the very long waiting hour.

Kudos to all the waiters and waitresses for their patience , as all other customers had been asking about the food many times too.

With over 4,000 Google reviews averaging 4.3 stars, I thought this place would be a must-try. Boy, was I wrong.

The System (5/5): To be fair, the queuing system is impressive. You first queue for a number. An old chap sizes up your group and allocates a suitable table. When your number is called, you queue for drinks. Once you’ve got those in hand, you queue again for food—only when your number comes up. Sounds tedious, but it’s actually orderly.

The Food (2/5):
•	Fish ICT (ikan celup tepung, RM6 each): Zero seasoning. Just gutted fish dipped in flour and deep-fried. Crispy, yes. Flavor? Nonexistent.
•	Cuttlefish (RM17): I came expecting the glorious whole squid from Mark Wiens’ YouTube video. Instead, got sad, chopped-up pieces.
•	Keropok Lekor (RM2 for 3 pcs): Supposedly a KT specialty. Here, it’s fried in the same bland flour batter. Forgettable.
•	Cuttlefish Eggs (RM8): The only saving grace. Clean, creamy, no fishy taste. Decent portion too.

The Rest:
•	Chili sauce: Watery and bland. Calling it a “dip” is generous.
•	Environment: Hot, no AC. Located by the seaside, which sounds nice until you’re sweating while eating. View is good though.
•	Parking: A nightmare. Brace yourself.

Verdict: Portions are okay, prices are reasonable, seafood is fresh—but freshness alone can’t save tasteless cooking. Service? What service? You’ll likely spend 1-1.5 hours here. Try it yourself if you must, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.",109043618795284114695,ChIJT95QnK-ktzERM1ZTu59kgyo_109043618795284114695,2025-09-20 10:23:11,Terengganu,restaurant,restaurant,Monday: 3:00-7:30PM | Tuesday: 3:00-7:30PM | Wednesday: 3:00-7:30PM | Thursday: 3:00-7:30PM | Friday: 3:00-7:30PM | Saturday: 3:00-7:30PM | Sunday: 3:00-7:30PM,3:00PM-7:30PM,3:00PM-7:30PM,3:00PM-7:30PM,3:00PM-7:30PM,3:00PM-7:30PM,3:00PM-7:30PM,3:00PM-7:30PM,Warung Pok Nong celup tepung,negative,False,0.9807

Let me share a few tips.

The issue likely comes from how you treat the tom yum paste. It’s already been sautéed during production, so boiling it for too long will make it bitter.

Here’s what you can do:

• Use a direct cooking method.

Wee – Disappointing!

When I travel on business, I often rely on Google reviews. Chinese non halal pork free restaurant. With 300+ reviews averaging 4.3 stars, this place looked promising. Sadly, I was conned again.

We arrived at 11 a.m. to an empty restaurant—just us. Staff were busy prepping in the kitchen. Ordering was simple: the friendly server hands you a menu and you write down your choices. Chice if meat and how you want it prepared. So far, so good.

The Food (or lack thereof):
•	Deep Fried Cuttlefish: Fresh, yes. Flavor, no. Bland and forgettable.
•	Ha Look Prawns: Six medium prawns, fresh but soggy. Honestly, I believe I could’ve cooked them better myself.
•	Lemon Chicken: How anyone can butcher such a simple dish is beyond me. Starchy chicken cutlets drowned in lemon “slime.” Disgusting.
•	Fried Meehoon: The worst dish I’ve had in my life—period. Burnt, starchy, and painful to finish. I never waste food, but this one was a test of willpower. Lesson in life: not all 4.3 stars are created equal.
•	Seafood Fried Rice: First two bites seemed fine, then it fell apart—unevenly cooked, bland, prawns not at their freshest.

The Rest:
•	No AC, but parking is aplenty.
•	Bill for all the above + two iced Chinese teas: RM75. Reasonable price, unreasonable regret.
•	The server was the only saving grace—smiling, polite, and attentive throughout. Kudos to her.

Verdict: One of the biggest letdowns of my food-hunting life.

Ordered the *Delight Tea Set*. Expected something elegant. Got... just regular Sabah tea. Okay lah, but not delightful.

The scone? Flat. Tired. Like it gave up halfway baking. Cream looked like mayo sandwiched in as a prank. I ate it, but my taste buds filed a complaint.

The muffin? Date took one look and said â€œno thanks.â€ Dense. Heavy. Very lame

The sandwich? Letâ€™s just say it looked better in the 90s. No crunch. No charm.

Only redeeming part is the setting, pretty, very Instagrammable. Just... maybe come for the view, not the food.

This was shocking, especially since the cancellation had only just occurred.

I decided to let that go and order lunch instead, also requesting a large cup of ice (even offering to pay for it). The request was flatly refused without any reasonable explanation. Apparently, providing ice in a cup for a paying customer is â€œimpossible.â€

What I saw next raised serious red flags: a larger female manager wearing glasses was openly eating fries from a customerâ€™s order and making herself a cup of coffee using company equipment.

This is a serious food safety hazard â€” if someone, especially a child, had accidentally swallowed it, it could have led to serious internal injuries.

Had dinner here with family, and placed a booking via WhatsApp, which was very responsive. The service provided was good, waiter & waitresses were friendly & courteous. Perhaps that's all the good points about this restaurant. Food was sadly lukewarm upon serving. Likely because they've cooked and prepared the booked order beforehand. Perhaps do not pre-book your orders and rather order on the spot upon arrival. Prawns were rather overpriced considering the portion & size.
Pros
- Good service
- Parking attendant available to guide you
- Quick response via WhatsApp
- Clean
Cons
- Some dishes are priced on the high side considering the portion given
- Food was lukewarm (likely because it was pre-booked)
- Taste of food does not justify the price
- Lazy Susan was a little malfunctioning (needs some lubricant)
- Chinese teapot does not pour out a nice stream of tea, causing a lot of wastage (can consider changing the teapot)

I went there for breakfast with friends, and unfortunately, the meal was far from enjoyable.

1. The fried noodles, kuey teow, and yellow noodles were unacceptably oily, making them completely unappetizing. It was hard to enjoy the meal when everything was drenched in so much oil.

2. The presentation was bizarre. I ordered the fried noodles, and logically, a spoon and fork should have been served with the dish. Instead, they were placed deep inside a small bowl of clear water. At first, I assumed it was hot water for hygienic purposes, but when we asked the staff, we were shocked to find out it was actually soup! This was an unprecedented and strange way of serving utensils, and while I wasnâ€™t expecting fine dining, it just felt odd and unprofessional. (Forgot to take photo but you guys can try and see)

3. The pan mee soup was incredibly salty, which completely spoiled my mood.

Overall, I can only describe this meal as a ""cholesterol meal set"" to start the day, and I sincerely hope the management takes these points into consideration for improvement. This was definitely not the standard I was expecting from such a popular kopitiam.
